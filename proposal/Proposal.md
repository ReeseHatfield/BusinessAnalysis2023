# Abstract


# Introduction

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline a data analysis research plan of New System Bakery.

## Background

Many businesses are reluctant to undergo data analyses of their companies, even at small scales, due to complicated and unsanitised data. Despite initial reluctance, the majority of business owns find great benefits when analyzing their business. Often times these benefits come in the form of identifying cost sinks and areas in need of improvement [1]. Datapine states that "Data based decision making provides businesses with the capabilities to generate real time insights and predictions to optimize their performance. Through this, they can test the success of different strategies and make informed business decisions for sustainable growth" [2], furthering the evidence for a need of data analysis in the business world. 

## Scope
I will be conducting an approximately three month research and data analysis plan to gain further insight into sales, and help make better business-oriented decisions.
# Approach

## Summer Sales Analysis:
The first step in our analysis will be to determine how much less business New System Bakery does in the summer months. We have already completed this analysis and found that the average daily sales in the summer are lower than the average daily sales during the rest of the year. We plan to continue this analysis by examining the specific days or weeks during the summer that have lower sales and identifying any patterns or trends that may contribute to the summer slump.

## Holiday Analysis:
Next, we will conduct an analysis of the bakery's sales during major holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. By comparing sales during these holidays to sales during the rest of the year, we hope to identify any seasonal patterns in the bakery's sales and plan accordingly.

## Regression Models for Food Costs:
To ensure that the bakery remains profitable, we will analyze the cost of food and ingredients used in the bakery's products. We plan to develop regression models that predict the cost of ingredients based on factors such as changes in the market price of goods and changes in the bakery's supply chain. By doing this, we hope to optimize the bakery's inventory management and reduce costs.

## Sales Forecasting:
In order to manage inventory and plan for staffing needs, we will also conduct sales forecasting. By analyzing sales data from previous years, we will develop models that predict future sales with a high degree of accuracy. This will enable the bakery to plan accordingly and avoid overstocking or understocking inventory.

## Weather Impact:
We will analyze how weather impacts the bakery's sales. By examining weather patterns over the course of the year and comparing them to sales data, we hope to identify any correlations between weather conditions and sales. This analysis will help the bakery plan accordingly for weather-related changes in business.

## Employee Analysis:
Finally, we will analyze employee scheduling and identify which employees are most likely to pick up work when the bakery is short-handed. By analyzing employee data and identifying patterns in scheduling, we hope to optimize the bakery's staffing and ensure that there are always enough workers on hand to meet demand.

# Results
The following is a summary of the expected results of each sub-project of the New System Bakery data analysis project:

## Summer Sales Analysis:
Based on the preliminary analysis conducted, we expect to find that New System Bakery experiences a decrease in sales during the summer months. The average daily sales during the summer months (June, July, and August) are expected to be lower than the daily sales during the rest of the year. Additionally, we expect to identify a seasonal pattern in the data, with sales peaking during busy seasons and dropping during slower seasons.

## Holiday Analysis:
We plan to conduct an analysis of the sales data during major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter. We expect to find that sales increase during these holidays, and we will identify which products are most in demand during these periods.

## Food Cost Regression:
We plan to build a regression model to analyze the relationship between food costs and sales. We expect to identify which food items have the highest cost and which items have the highest margins. We will also explore the impact of food costs on overall profits.

## Sales Forecasting:
We plan to develop a sales forecasting model that will help New System Bakery predict sales for the upcoming year. We will use historical sales data to build the model and identify seasonal trends that impact sales. We expect to provide New System Bakery with accurate sales forecasts that can help them make informed decisions about inventory and staffing.

## Weather Impact Analysis:
We plan to analyze the impact of weather on sales. We expect to find that certain weather conditions, such as rain or extreme temperatures, have a significant impact on sales. By identifying these patterns, we will be able to provide New System Bakery with recommendations on how to adjust their operations to account for these conditions.

## Employee Analysis:
Finally, we plan to analyze employee data to identify which employees are most effective at picking up shifts when the staff is short-handed. By identifying these employees, we will be able to provide New System Bakery with recommendations on how to optimize their staffing and ensure they are adequately covered during busy periods.

The results of this analysis will be presented in several ways. First, we will create visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs to show the trends and patterns in the data. These will be presented in documents, along with explanations of the key findings and takeaways.

## Results Presentation
In addition, we will provide detailed written reports summarizing the results of each analysis, along with recommendations for how New System Bakery can use this information to improve their business. These reports will be available in PDF format and will be shared with key stakeholders, including the management team.

## Statement of Work

### Task 1: Data collection and cleaning - 2 weeks

- Collect relevant data from all sources
- Conduct preliminary data cleaning and quality checks
### Task 2: Exploratory data analysis and visualization - 3 weeks

- Analyze and visualize the data to identify patterns and insights
- Conduct statistical analysis to identify correlations and trends
### Task 3: Regression analysis for food costs - 3 weeks

- Develop a regression model to analyze food costs based on variables such as menu items, seasonality, and supplier prices
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement
### Task 4: Sales forecasting - 2 weeks

- Develop a forecasting model to predict sales trends based on historical data and other relevant variables such as weather, promotions, and events
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement
### Task 5: Employee analysis - 2 weeks

- Analyze employee data to identify trends in employee performance, absenteeism, and willingness to pick up work
- Develop recommendations for improving employee performance and scheduling
### Task 6: Final report and presentation - 2 weeks

- Compile the findings and recommendations from the analysis tasks into a final report
- Develop a presentation to effectively communicate the results to the management

Note: This timeline assumes that all necessary data is readily available and that the project team has the required resources and expertise to complete each task. Delays or unexpected challenges may impact the timeline.
