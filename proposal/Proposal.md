# Abstract


# Introduction

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline a data analysis research plan of New System Bakery.

## Background

Many businesses are reluctant to undergo data analyses of their companies, even at small scales, due to complicated and unsanitised data. Despite initial reluctance, the majority of business owns find great benefits when analyzing their business. Often times these benefits come in the form of identifying cost sinks and areas in need of improvement [1]. Datapine further states that "Data based decision making provides businesses with the capabilities to generate real time insights and predictions to optimize their performance. Through this, they can test the success of different strategies and make informed business decisions for sustainable growth" [2]
